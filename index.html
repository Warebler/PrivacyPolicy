<h1>Warebler Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" class="alert-link" title="Too long; didn't read">tl;dr</a>: Our core policy is that we don't want your data and try to collect as little as is necessary to make things work. We only use data we must collect in an ethical, legal, and responsible way. We do not sell your data and only share it when legally required (see below for details)</div>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Privacy is extremely important to us. We want our privacy as users and think you should have it, too. Our goal is to provide our services while collecting as little data as necessary and only using what we have to collect for essential purposes. We don't sell your data. In the cases where we have to use third party services (email hosting, cloud servers, etc.), we ensure that the privacy policies of those third parties are in line with our privacy requirements, and take additional steps, where possible, to protect your data using encryption and other methods.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We collect IP addresses, user agent information, email addresses, and names.</div>

<p>When you use the Internet, your browser sends information to websites about the browser (Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) and the operating system (Linux, Mac, Windows, etc.) that you are using. This is needed because browsers on disparate operating systems work a little bit differently, so sometimes sites need to tweak how things are done for your specific browser or operating system. This information is called your user agent information. It does not personally identify you; rather it identifies the agent you are using, i.e., your browser version and operating system. This information is logged when you use our sites and services. This is standard practice and is necessary for us to manage our sites and services properly. Please see the "How we use collected data" section for details on why.</p>

<p>IP addresses are the mailing addresses of the Internet. Unlike real mailing addresses, they are often dynamic, meaning that they can change over time, and they can be shared among a number of users. Whenever you browse to a site on the Internet or use an Internet service, you send your current IP address with any traffic you generate so that the the receiver knows where to send responses back to. We log IP addresses when you use our sites and services. This is standard practice and is necessary for us to manage our sites and services properly. Please see the "How we use collected data" section for details on why.</p>

<p>If you send us an email, support request, feedback, etc., then we will have any information that you send us, potentially including an email address and your name if you choose to include them. We welcome you to use a fake name, username, initial, title, etc. – whatever makes you comfortable. We have no reason to need your real or full name. We try to make email addresses optional where possible, though if you want us to get back to you, you will of course need to include one. If you are under the age of 13, please have a parent/guardian or older sibling email, request support, or provide feedback for you.</p>

<h2>How We Use Collected Data</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We only use collected data for essential purposes, i.e., to provide you with services, to maintain those services, and to respond to you about issues, feedback, or questions you have about those services.</div>

<h4>IP Address and User Agent Information:</h4>

<p>We use logged IP addresses and user agent data to help us identify and fix issues with our sites and services. For example, if we notice that a particular combination of browser version and operating system is having issues across multiple users, then we know that we need to test with that same configuration so that we can find the issue. We also use this data for various other maintenance, security, and debugging purposes. For example, counting the number of unique IP addresses that accessed a site in a given time period can give us a rough estimate of the number of users a site or service has.</p>

<p>Since IP addresses are usually dynamic and user agent information isn't about you personally, they don't usually directly identify who you are. However, some people have figured out ways to use the two together to narrow down who a user may be, and in many cases are able to identify and track users with surprising accuracy using only these pieces. We do not track you and make no attempt to link a logged IP address or user agent information to you except in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have reported an issue with one of our sites or services and it is a complex enough issue that we need to, with your help, figure out your IP address and user agent information so that we can track down the issue. Once the issue is solved, the link between you and this information will not be stored.</li>

<li>We believe that we have discovered a hack. In this case, we will make an attempt to identify who the user is with the help of law enforcement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Name and Email Address:</h4>

<p>We will use the name and email address you give us, if any, to respond to the feedback, support request, email, etc. that you sent us. We will not send you unsolicited emails (mailing lists, newsletters, advertisements, etc.).</p>

<h2>How Long Is Data Stored</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We periodically delete data once it is no longer needed.</div>

<p>Server logs are routinely wiped and with them IP addresses and user agent information that were logged.</p>

<p>Information sent to us as part of an email, a support request, feedback, etc., which can contain things like name, email address, contents of emails, etc., is periodically purged.</p>

<p>The only data we store long term is data that we are required to keep for legal and/or regulatory reasons.</p>

<h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>

<p>The best way to protect user data is to not collect it in the first place, so our first step to protect your data is to minimize its collection to only data that is strictly necessary. This significantly limits what we could lose in a data breach.</p>

<p>For the data that we do collect, we follow industry best practices to protect it, including, but not limited to, using encryption everywhere possible, using strong passwords, and regularly purging data we no longer need.</p>

<h2>When We Share Your Data</h2>

<p>We normally do not share customer data, but there are a few exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When required to by law, for example, when we are presented with a subpoena or warrant, or we have a regulatory requirement, we will turn over the data.</li>

<li>If our services or sites are attacked, we may share any information we have about the attacker with law enforcement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Data We Sell</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We do NOT sell your data.</div>

<p>Surprisingly that statement still leaves a lot of wiggle room using just the standard definition of sell. For example, does getting paid by an ad company for allowing them to show an ad in our product which they use to collect data about you count as selling data, since the ad company collected the data themselves and just paid us to "show" you an ad?  In our opinion, that counts as selling your data, and we don't do that or anything like it.</p>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines selling data in this way:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
“‘Sell,’ ‘selling,’ ‘sale,’ or ‘sold,’ means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.”
</blockquote>

<p>Under this much broader definition, we still are able to proudly say that we do not sell your data, even if you don't live in California.</p>

<h2>Do Not Track</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We don’t track you.</div>

<p>Do Not Track or DNT is a header that you can configure your browser to send to sites that you browse on the web which notifies them that you do or do not want to be tracked. Unfortunately sites are not required to honor it, so it is widely ignored and most sites still track you regardless of if being set to opt out. We actually ignore it, too, but in the opposite way. We do not track users and we do not use any third party tools or services that would allow a third party to track you while using our sites or services. Do Not Track headers therefore have no effect on our sites and services because our policy is to never track or allow tracking, even if the header is set to explicitly opt into tracking.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We use cookies, but only for essential purposes.</div>

<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by websites that you visit which are used to cache information that you need to send to the site with every request. The server needs you to send this information to the server so that it can provide you with a secure and persistent session. Cookies are an essential part of how websites function, and are necessary for all but the simplest websites to work. Unfortunately, over time some people have realized that cookies can be abused to allow them to track your browsing habits across the Internet. These cookies are commonly called tracking cookies. We strongly disapprove of using cookies in this manner and do not use them for tracking purposes. We also do not use third party services that would allow anyone to track you on our sites and services using cookies or any other method. We use only first-party cookies (cookies that we create) for strictly necessary purposes (temporary session persistence and security) and they have a session lifetime (meaning they will be deleted when you close your browser).</p>

<h2>User Rights</h2>

<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) users in California are required to be granted the following rights. However, we think these are rights that everyone should have so we grant them to all of our users, no matter where you live. Our users have the following rights:</p>

<h4>Right to Know</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">You have the right to ask us what data we have collected, shared, or sold about you, and why we have collected, shared, or sold that data.</div> 

<p>This privacy policy documents what we collect, when we collect it, why we collect it, and how we use or share it, but you are welcome to ask us questions about anything that is unclear, or if you have questions about the information we have collected about you specifically. This is a list of specific information that we are required to provide, but you are also welcome to ask additional questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information collected</li>
<li>Specific pieces of personal information collected</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which we collected personal information</li>
<li>The purposes for which we use the personal information</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share the personal information</li>
<li>The categories of information that we sell or disclose to third parties</li>
</ul>

<p>You can send your requests to <a href="mailto:privacy@warebler.com">privacy@warebler.com</a>. This information will be, and is required to be, provided free of charge.</p>

<h4>Right to Delete</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">You have the right to request that we delete your collected personal information.</div>

<p>We have 45 days to respond and can extend this period by another 45 days to a total of 90 days if we notify you that we need more time within the first 45 days. There are some exceptions to what we can delete, but we will delete all that we can and we will notify you of what was deleted, what could not be deleted, and why we could not delete it. A typical reason that would prevent us from deleting something would be a legal reason requiring us to keep it. For example, if you sent us a request to opt-out of the sale of your data (we do not sell data even if you don't opt-out), then we would be required to keep information given in that request so that we can comply with your opt-out request.</P>

<p>You can send your requests to <a href="mailto:privacy@warebler.com">privacy@warebler.com</a>. This will be processed free of charge.</p>

<h4>Right to Opt-Out</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.</div>

<p>We do not and will not ever sell your personal data, but you may still send us a request to opt-out of the sale of your data if you wish at <a href="mailto:privacy@warebler.com">privacy@warebler.com</a>. This will be processed free of charge.</p>

<h4>Right to Non-Discrimination</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights.</div>

<p>Specifically, we cannot discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights by charging you more or giving you a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>

<h2>Updates to the privacy policy</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We will need to update this policy occasionally, but we will always keep the spirit of this document, i.e., we won’t collect data we don’t need and won’t sell your data.</div>

<p>We have tried to make our policy transparent, which means it goes into quite a lot of detail about exactly what data we collect, and when and why we collect it. As we add and improve services, what data is necessary or how we use it may change, so we will update this policy to keep everything transparent.</p>

<p>Since we try to minimize our data collection, we don't have email addresses for all of our users (or even store the email addresses that we do collect for long term use) and we don't send our users unsolicited emails, so when the policy is changed, we can't easily notify users directly. When changes need to be made, we will put up a notice on our website 30 days before the policy goes into effect and it will stay up 30 days after the policy changes to give users a reasonable chance to see that it has been updated. You can see old versions of the policy <a href="https://github.com/Warebler/PrivacyPolicy">here</a> so you can see how it has changed over time.</p>

<p>Any updates that we do make to the policy will maintain the spirit of the original: we will only collect data that is absolutely necessary; we will only use it for necessary, ethical, and responsible purposes; we won't sell your data; and if we use third party services to provide you with our services, we will hold them to the same privacy standards and take steps to safeguard your data from them as much as possible. We will treat your privacy and your data in the same way that we want companies that we do business with to treat ours.</p>
